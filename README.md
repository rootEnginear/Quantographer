# Quantographer

> This project is a part of CPE401 Computer Engineering Project I and CPE402 Computer Engineering Project II, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi. For detailed information, please read the project report (soon).

In this project, we have created a quantum circuit editor to help end users comprehend,
analyze, optimize, and select the statistically optimum transpiler for their quantum circuit.
We performed transpiler benchmarking using the advantages of the Qiskit library and
incorporated the results to assist us prioritize the settings in our recommendation system.
Furthermore, we conducted a user usability test comparing our solution to similar products.
As a result, we are able to adjust and enhance the user experience to be comparable
with other products.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
